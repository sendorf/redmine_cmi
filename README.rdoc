  management for CMMI certificate.

== Getting the plugin

A copy of the plugin can be found in the {downloads}[http://forja.cenatic.es/]
section at Cenatic Forge and also on
{Github}[https://github.com/Emergya/redmine_cmi]. A mirror of the project
repository is also available in
{Gitorious}[https://gitorious.org/redmine_cmi/redmine_cmi].

== Install

Important note: read install notes before installing.

1. Make sure you have installed the Redmine version 1.0.0 or higher.
2. Follow the Redmine plugin installation steps at:
   http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.
3. Edit the following files:
   * config/defaults.yml
     Translate perfil (profile) to your language. The cmi:create_data task
     creates a user custom field with this name.
   * db/fixtures/history_profiles_costs.csv
     Hourly cost of each profile (by year). The cmi:load_role_costs_history
     loads the information from this file to the database.
   * db/fixtures/history_user_profiles.csv
     Historic user profile evolution: which user had which profile at a point
     in time? The cmi:load_user_role_history loads the information from this
     file to the database.
4. Install the plugin running the commands below from your Redmine directory
   (if you are going to run Redmine in, e.g. the production environment, you
   need to append RAILS_ENV=production to each line). The last one is only
   needed if you are upgrading from CMI 0.9.4.1 or lower:
     rake db:migrate:plugin NAME=redmine_cmi
     bundle exec rake cmi:create_data cmi:load_role_costs_history cmi:load_user_role_history cmi:recalculate_costs RAILS_ENV=production
5. Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails).
6. Login to your Redmine install as an Administrator.
7. Under admininstration, custom fields, users, edit the perfil (profile)
   custom field and change the possible values according to the values you used
   to edit the files in step 3.
8. Configure the plugin under administration, plugins.
9. Enable the permissions for your Roles.

== Install notes

The plugin needs one custom field to work. This field is created by the rake
task cmi:create_data, based on the configuration in config/defaults.yml, but
there is no automated way to remove it.

It is, thus, advisable to do a database backup before trying the plugin.

== Uninstall

As stated above, you'll have to manually remove the created custom field and
values.

The plugin also makes some database schema changes wich you should revert. Stop
the server and in redmine's directory run (if you are running Redmine in,
e.g. the production environment, you need to append RAILS_ENV=production):

 rake db:migrate:plugin NAME=redmine_cmi VERSION=0

After this you can remove the plugin's directory (vendor/plugins/redmine_cmi)
and restart the server.
